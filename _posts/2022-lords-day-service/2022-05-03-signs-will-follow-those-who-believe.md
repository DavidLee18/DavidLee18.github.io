God  <br>
is the Living One.  <br>
He <br>
showed that He is alive in various ways (Heb 1:1). <br>
God is the Almighty and He is like a potter (Rom 9:21). <br>
He created the world (Gen 1:1) <br>
and made man into a living being (Gen 2:7). <br>
He saved eight people with the ark (1 Pet 3:20), <br>
ordered Israel to come out of Egypt under Moses (Ex 7:1-2), <br>
and gave victory in war through Joshua (Js 1:1-6). <br>
He used Elijah to stop the rain <br>
and made it return in 3 years and 6 months (1 Kgs 18:41-46). <br>
He was finally born in the land of Judea (Mt 2:1-2) <br>
and revealed God and His kingdom (Jn 14:8-11). <br>
He personally died and resurrected (Acts 2:31-32). <br>
By sending the Holy Spirit, He testifies that He has risen (Acts 1:8) <br>
and gives testimony by signs to those who believe it. <br>
Consequently, <br>
great signs will follow those who believe (Mk 16:17). <br>
This was the testimony when the disciples went out <br>
and preached everywhere. The Lord worked with them <br>
and confirmed His word <br>
by the accompanying signs (Mk 16:19-20). <br>
○ Just as soldiers are armed with rifles, <br>
His power and signs follow those who believe. <br>
○ The kingdom of God is not in words <br>
but should be spoken in power. <br>
○ If the kingdom of God comes to us, <br>
demons will certainly empty their places and leave. <br>
We should not boast about having no power. It is unfortunate. <br>
※ Let’s receive the Holy Spirit <br>
and let’s receive His power. <br>
The manifestation of the Spirit is given for the profit of all. <br>
